## How to Use This Roadmap

Each **phase** is a self-contained milestone. Complete all tasks within a phase before moving to the next. Each task has:
- A checkbox `[ ]` — tick it when done
- An **owner hint** (Frontend / Backend / Design / DevOps)
- Concrete **deliverables** and **acceptance criteria** at the end of each phase

---

## Phase 0 — Environment & Project Scaffolding

> **Goal:** A running local dev server with the folder structure in place, Firebase project created, and all dependencies installed.

## Phase 1 — Header & Navigation

> **Goal:** A fixed, luxury-styled header with navigation links and a responsive hamburger menu.

| # | Task | Owner | Notes |
|---|------|-------|-------|
| 1.1 | [ ] Build the HTML structure in `index.html`: `<header>` with `<nav>` containing links for **Histoire**, **Activités**, **Documents**, **Concours**, **Serment Techno**, **Suggestions** | Frontend | Use semantic `<nav>` and `<a>` with `href="#section-id"` |
| 1.2 | [ ] Create `Header.js` component: attach smooth-scroll behavior to each nav link | Frontend | Use `element.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })` |
| 1.3 | [ ] Style the header: fixed position, glassmorphism background (`backdrop-filter: blur()`), gold accent border-bottom, Cinzel font for brand name | Design | `z-index` must be above the 3D canvas |
| 1.4 | [ ] Add a **Login** button in the header (right side) — no functionality yet, just the UI element | Frontend | Style as a ghost/outlined gold button |
| 1.5 | [ ] Build the hamburger menu icon (CSS-only or minimal JS toggle) | Frontend | Three-line icon that animates to an ✕ on open |
| 1.6 | [ ] Create the mobile slide-out or overlay menu | Frontend | Full-screen overlay with nav links stacked vertically |
| 1.7 | [ ] Add responsive breakpoint: collapse nav links into hamburger at `≤ 768px` | Design | Use `@media` queries in `responsive.css` |

### ✅ Phase 1 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Header stays fixed on scroll, with gold accent and glass effect
- [ ] Clicking any nav link smooth-scrolls to the corresponding `<section>`
- [ ] On mobile (≤ 768px), nav collapses into a hamburger menu that toggles an overlay
- [ ] Login button is visible but non-functional

---

## Phase 2 — Hero Section & Content Sections

> **Goal:** A stunning hero with branded title/subtitle/CTA, plus static content sections for Histoire, Activités, Concours, and Serment Techno.

| # | Task | Owner | Notes |
|---|------|-------|-------|
| 2.1 | [ ] Create the `<section id="hero">` in `index.html`: large title (Cinzel), subtitle (Playfair Display), and a gold CTA button | Frontend | CTA can link to `#documents` or `#activites` |
| 2.2 | [ ] Build `Hero.js`: entrance animation (fade-in + slide-up on load) for the hero text and button | Frontend | Use CSS `@keyframes` or JS `IntersectionObserver` |
| 2.3 | [ ] Style the hero: full-viewport height, centered content, text-shadow for depth, gradient overlay to ensure text readability over future 3D canvas | Design | — |
| 2.4 | [ ] Create `<section id="histoire">`: association mission & vision content | Frontend | Use Playfair Display for headings, Inter for body |
| 2.5 | [ ] Create `<section id="activites">`: placeholder timeline structure | Frontend | Will be enhanced in Phase 2b |
| 2.6 | [ ] Build `Timeline.js`: a vertical or horizontal timeline component with activity cards (date, description, theme/keywords) | Frontend | Start with hardcoded data; data-driven version can come later |
| 2.7 | [ ] Style activity cards: glassmorphism card with gold border on hover, subtle scale animation | Design | — |
| 2.8 | [ ] Create `<section id="concours">`: descriptions for CCINP, X Polytechnique, etc. | Frontend | Use grid/flexbox cards layout |
| 2.9 | [ ] Create `<section id="serment-techno">`: membership, commitments, payment/promo info | Frontend | — |
| 2.10 | [ ] Add scroll-triggered entrance animations to all sections (fade-in, slide-up) | Frontend | Use `IntersectionObserver` in `app.js` |

### ✅ Phase 2 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Hero is full-viewport, visually impactful, with animated text entrance
- [ ] All four content sections render with styled headings and body text
- [ ] The Activités section has a timeline with at least 3 sample activity cards
- [ ] Scroll-triggered animations fire correctly as each section enters the viewport

---

## Phase 3 — 3D Canvas & Particle Background

> **Goal:** A lightweight Three.js scene behind the hero/header with optional particle effects.

| # | Task | Owner | Notes |
|---|------|-------|-------|
| 3.1 | [ ] Install Three.js (`npm i three`) | DevOps | — |
| 3.2 | [ ] Create `Canvas3D.js`: initialize a `WebGLRenderer`, `Scene`, `PerspectiveCamera` | Frontend | Render to a `<canvas>` element positioned behind hero |
| 3.3 | [ ] Add low-poly floating geometry (e.g., icosahedrons, torus knots) with gold wireframe or emissive material | Frontend | Keep draw calls under 20 for performance |
| 3.4 | [ ] Animate geometry: slow rotation, gentle floating motion | Frontend | Use `requestAnimationFrame` loop |
| 3.5 | [ ] Create `Particles.js`: add a particle system (using `THREE.Points` or a custom shader) | Frontend | Gold/white particles, slow drift |
| 3.6 | [ ] Layer the canvas: set `position: fixed`, `z-index: -1`, `pointer-events: none` | Design | Ensure it doesn't intercept clicks |
| 3.7 | [ ] Add a **pause/disable toggle** for the 3D animation | Frontend | Button in footer or hero corner; saves preference to `localStorage` |
| 3.8 | [ ] Auto-disable or simplify canvas on mobile / low-power devices | Frontend | Check `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` or viewport width |
| 3.9 | [ ] Performance audit: ensure ≤ 16ms frame time on mid-range hardware | Frontend | Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab |

### ✅ Phase 3 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 3D canvas renders behind the hero with floating geometry and particles
- [ ] Canvas does NOT capture pointer events (buttons and links still clickable)
- [ ] A toggle exists to pause/disable the animation
- [ ] On mobile, animation is simplified or disabled automatically
- [ ] No visible frame drops on desktop (60 fps target)

---

## Phase 4 — Document Library Modal (Read-Only)

> **Goal:** A polished two-pane document library modal that reads documents from Firestore.

| # | Task | Owner | Notes |
|---|------|-------|-------|
| 4.1 | [ ] Create the Firestore `documents` collection and seed it with 5–10 sample documents (manually or via script) | Backend | Fields: `name`, `category`, `type`, `academicYear`, `storagePath`, `filename`, `createdBy`, `createdAt` |
| 4.2 | [ ] Upload corresponding sample files to Firebase Storage under `/documents/{year}/{category}/{filename}` | Backend | PDFs or placeholder files |
| 4.3 | [ ] Build `DocumentLibrary.js`: modal/overlay component with backdrop blur | Frontend | Triggered by clicking "Documents" in nav |
| 4.4 | [ ] Implement the **left pane** — tree navigation with categories and subjects | Frontend | Categories: 1ère Année, 2ème Année, Concours Spéciaux. Subjects: Mathématiques, Physique, Chimie, S.I., Informatique, CCINP, ISFA, X Polytechnique, École Centrale Casablanca, Gbinzin |
| 4.5 | [ ] Implement expand/collapse behavior for tree nodes | Frontend | CSS transitions + JS toggle |
| 4.6 | [ ] Implement active selection highlighting on tree nodes | Frontend | Gold left-border + subtle background change |
| 4.7 | [ ] Build `DocumentCard.js`: card component showing title, meta (year, type, category), and a **Download** button | Frontend | — |
| 4.8 | [ ] Implement `fetchDocuments(category)` in `firebase.js`: query Firestore filtered by `category` | Backend | Use `where()` clause; order by `createdAt desc` |
| 4.9 | [ ] Wire tree selection → Firestore query → render document cards in the **right pane** | Frontend | Show a loading spinner during fetch |
| 4.10 | [ ] Implement the **Download** action: generate a signed URL or use `getDownloadURL()` from Firebase Storage | Backend | Open in new tab or trigger browser download |
| 4.11 | [ ] Modal close: clicking backdrop, pressing Escape, or clicking an ✕ button | Frontend | Trap keyboard focus inside modal for accessibility |
| 4.12 | [ ] Animate modal open/close (scale + fade transition) | Design | — |

### ✅ Phase 4 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clicking "Documents" opens a full-screen modal with glass styling
- [ ] Left tree shows categories; clicking a category fetches and displays document cards
- [ ] Download button successfully opens/downloads the file
- [ ] Modal can be closed via backdrop click, Escape key, or ✕ button
- [ ] Modal is keyboard-accessible (focus trap, tab navigation)

---

## Phase 5 — Authentication & Admin Gating

> **Goal:** Bureau members can log in; admin-only UI elements appear only when authenticated.

| # | Task | Owner | Notes |
|---|------|-------|-------|
| 5.1 | [ ] Build `LoginForm.js`: modal or dropdown with email and password fields + submit button | Frontend | Triggered by the header "Login" button |
| 5.2 | [ ] Implement `signInWithEmailAndPassword()` using Firebase Auth | Backend | Handle errors: wrong password, user not found |
| 5.3 | [ ] Create 1–2 test admin accounts in Firebase Console (Auth → Users) | DevOps | — |
| 5.4 | [ ] Set admin flag: either via Firestore `users` collection (`{ uid, role: 'admin' }`) or Firebase custom claims | Backend | Custom claims require a Cloud Function; `users` collection is simpler for MVP |
| 5.5 | [ ] Implement `onAuthStateChanged()` listener in `app.js` — on login, check admin flag and set a global `isAdmin` state | Backend | — |
| 5.6 | [ ] Conditionally show/hide admin UI: **Upload button** in document library, **Delete button** on document cards, **Suggestions** nav link (admin dashboard variant) | Frontend | Toggle visibility via CSS class or DOM manipulation |
| 5.7 | [ ] Add a **Logout** button (replaces Login when authenticated) | Frontend | Calls `signOut()` |
| 5.8 | [ ] Show user feedback: "Logged in as [email]" toast or small indicator in header | Frontend | — |
| 5.9 | [ ] Handle auth errors gracefully with user-friendly messages | Frontend | e.g., "Invalid credentials. Please try again." |

### ✅ Phase 5 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clicking "Login" opens a form; valid credentials log the user in
- [ ] After login, admin-only elements (upload, delete, suggestions dashboard) become visible
- [ ] Logging out hides admin elements and shows the Login button again
- [ ] Invalid credentials show an error message (not a raw Firebase error)

---

## Phase 6 — Document Upload (Admin)

> **Goal:** Authenticated admins can upload documents via a form; files go to Storage, metadata to Firestore.

| # | Task | Owner | Notes |
|---|------|-------|-------|
| 6.1 | [ ] Build the **Upload Form** UI inside the document library modal (visible only to admins) | Frontend | Fields: Document name, Category (dropdown matching tree), Document type (pdf/notes/exam), Academic year, File input |
| 6.2 | [ ] Validate form inputs client-side before submission | Frontend | Required fields, file size limit (e.g., 20 MB), accepted MIME types |
| 6.3 | [ ] Implement `uploadDocument(metadata, file)` in `firebase.js`: upload file to Storage at `/documents/{year}/{category}/{filename}` | Backend | Use `uploadBytesResumable()` for progress tracking |
| 6.4 | [ ] On successful upload, write metadata document to Firestore `documents` collection | Backend | Include `storagePath`, `createdBy` (current user UID), `createdAt` (server timestamp) |
| 6.5 | [ ] Show an **upload progress bar** during file upload | Frontend | Use the `state_changed` observer from `uploadBytesResumable` |
| 6.6 | [ ] Display a **success notification** (toast) on successful upload | Frontend | Auto-dismiss after 3 seconds |
| 6.7 | [ ] Display an **error notification** if upload or Firestore write fails | Frontend | — |
| 6.8 | [ ] After successful upload, refresh the document list for the current category | Frontend | — |

### ✅ Phase 6 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Admin sees an "Upload" button in the document library; clicking it reveals the form
- [ ] Submitting the form uploads the file to Storage and creates a Firestore document
- [ ] A progress bar shows upload progress; a success toast appears on completion
- [ ] The newly uploaded document appears in the document card grid immediately
- [ ] Non-admin users do NOT see the upload button

---

## Phase 7 — Document Delete (Admin) + Storage Cleanup

> **Goal:** Admins can delete documents; deletion removes both the Firestore record and the Storage file.

| # | Task | Owner | Notes |
|---|------|-------|-------|
| 7.1 | [ ] Add a **Delete** button/icon on each `DocumentCard` (visible only to admins) | Frontend | Use a trash icon with a red hover state |
| 7.2 | [ ] Implement a **confirmation dialog** before deletion ("Are you sure you want to delete [name]?") | Frontend | — |
| 7.3 | [ ] Implement `deleteDocument(docId, storagePath)` in `firebase.js`: delete Firestore document + delete file from Storage | Backend | Use `deleteDoc()` + `deleteObject()` |
| 7.4 | [ ] Show a **success notification** after deletion | Frontend | — |
| 7.5 | [ ] Remove the deleted card from the UI without a full re-fetch (optimistic update) | Frontend | — |
| 7.6 | [ ] Handle errors (e.g., file already deleted from Storage) gracefully | Backend | — |

### ✅ Phase 7 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Admin sees a delete icon on each document card
- [ ] Clicking delete shows a confirmation; confirming removes the document from Firestore and Storage
- [ ] The card disappears from the grid with a fade-out animation
- [ ] Non-admin users do NOT see the delete button

---

## Phase 8 — Suggestions System

> **Goal:** Public users can submit suggestions; admins have a dashboard to view, filter, and manage them.

| # | Task | Owner | Notes |
|---|------|-------|-------|
| 8.1 | [ ] Create the Firestore `suggestions` collection (no seed data needed) | Backend | Fields: `category`, `title`, `description`, `status` ("unread"), `createdAt`, `email` (optional) |
| 8.2 | [ ] Build `SuggestionsForm.js`: public form with category selector, title input, description textarea, optional email input | Frontend | Place in `<section id="suggestions">` |
| 8.3 | [ ] Implement **live preview**: as the user types, mirror title and description into a styled card beside the form | Frontend | Update on `input` event |
| 8.4 | [ ] Implement `submitSuggestion(data)` in `firebase.js`: add document to `suggestions` collection with `status: 'unread'` and `createdAt: serverTimestamp()` | Backend | — |
| 8.5 | [ ] Show **success notification** on submission; reset the form | Frontend | — |
| 8.6 | [ ] Build `AdminDashboard.js` (suggestions section): **stats cards** showing total count, unread count, recent count (last 7 days) | Frontend | Query Firestore for counts |
| 8.7 | [ ] Build `SuggestionList.js`: list/grid of suggestion cards with category badge, title, description preview, status indicator, and date | Frontend | — |
| 8.8 | [ ] Implement **filters**: by category dropdown, toggle "unread only" | Frontend | Re-query Firestore with `where()` clauses |
| 8.9 | [ ] Implement **Mark as Read** action: update `status` to `"read"` in Firestore | Backend | — |
| 8.10 | [ ] Implement **Delete Suggestion** action with confirmation | Backend | — |
| 8.11 | [ ] Wire the admin dashboard so it's accessible only when logged in as admin | Frontend | Could be a separate modal/view or a section that replaces the public suggestions form |

### ✅ Phase 8 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Any visitor can fill out and submit the suggestion form
- [ ] Live preview updates in real time as the user types
- [ ] A success message appears and the form resets after submission
- [ ] Admin dashboard shows total, unread, and recent suggestion counts
- [ ] Admin can filter by category and unread status
- [ ] Admin can mark a suggestion as read or delete it
- [ ] Non-admin users see only the public form, not the dashboard

---

## Phase 9 — Firebase Security Rules

> **Goal:** Production-ready security rules that enforce the access model defined in the spec.

| # | Task | Owner | Notes |
|---|------|-------|-------|
| 9.1 | [ ] Write **Firestore security rules** | Backend | See rules template below |
| 9.2 | [ ] Write **Storage security rules** | Backend | See rules template below |
| 9.3 | [ ] Test rules using the **Firebase Emulator Suite** | Backend | Run `firebase emulators:start` |
| 9.4 | [ ] Test positive cases: public read documents, public create suggestion, admin upload/delete | Backend | — |
| 9.5 | [ ] Test negative cases: unauthenticated upload, unauthenticated suggestion delete, non-admin delete | Backend | — |
| 9.6 | [ ] Deploy rules to production (`firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage`) | DevOps | — |

### Firestore Rules Template
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Documents: public read, admin write/delete
    match /documents/{docId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow create, update, delete: if request.auth != null

    }
  }
}
```

### ✅ Phase 9 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All Firestore/Storage rules are deployed
- [ ] Emulator tests pass for both positive and negative access scenarios
- [ ] No console errors related to permission denials in normal usage flows
